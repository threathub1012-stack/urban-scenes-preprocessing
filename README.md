# Urban Scenes – Preprocessing Utilities

This repository contains lightweight preprocessing and validation scripts
used during preparation of the Urban Scenes v2 dataset.

The utilities here were used during our internal experiments to normalize
features and perform basic distribution checks prior to release.

## Contents

- preprocess.py – feature normalization helpers
- label_map.json – class label mapping

## Notes

Raw data is not included due to licensing and redistribution constraints.
Only derived features and statistics were used during preprocessing.
